For this program to work, input two time values separted by an operator (either + or minus.)
Using non negative numbers, enter the time in the following format:

A (seconds) B (minutes) C (hours) D (days) (No strings)

an operator (+ or -)

A (seconds) B (minutes) C (hours) D (days)

The operation reduces to smallest form.
